# SuperBanAWM
Plugin SuperBan | Minecraft Bedrock Edition | API 1.0.14 | Nukkit | SupportAWM


***Features:***<br />
:star: Our new ban system is designed to be highly effective at preventing players who have repeatedly violated the rules from bypassing the system and continuing to play. It uses a large amount of data from config files to accurately identify these players and ban them.<br />

:star: **``However, it is important to keep in mind that this ban system relies on comparing a lot of data, and as such it can potentially have an impact on the performance of your server. If you use the ban system to ban a small number of players, it is unlikely to cause any significant performance issues. However, if you use it to ban a large number of players, it could potentially lead to a decrease in performance``** !!!<br />

:star: Therefore, it is important to use this ban system responsibly and only ban players who have repeatedly and severely violated the rules. By limiting the number of players who are banned with this system, you can help to ensure that it does not negatively impact the performance of your server.<br />

❗️: The SuperBanAWM plugin is a useful tool, but it is important to keep in mind that it is a free version and may not have the same level of optimization as a paid plugin! Let me know if you are interested in a paid version of the SuperBanAWM plugin with a better optimization and I would be happy to provide more information.
